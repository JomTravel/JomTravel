        <p>
          If countries were awarded for diversity, Malaysia would top first place. Not only is Malaysia a melting pot of
          ethnic cultures, but it is also a blend of many different customs, cuisines and religions all coexisting
          peacefully together. From large island groups to mountains, fertile highlands, tropical rainforest and
          mangrove estuaries, the country's geography is every bit as diverse.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
          What's more, Malaysia is a unique country in that is divided into two main landmasses. West Malaysia occupies
          the southern half of a peninsula shared with Thailand, while across the South China Sea is East Malaysia,
          situated on the Borneo island.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
          West Malaysia is home to the capital city, Kuala Lumpur, a large metropolis of impressive skyscrapers,
          fabulous shopping districts, museums, theaters, hotels, international restaurants and buzzing nightlife.
          Melaka is a city rich in history, architecture and traditions. Penang Island is famous for its exquisite
          cuisine and beautiful colonial George Town. A visit to the Cameron Highlands offers cool weather and
          spectacular scenery of flower farms and tea plantations. Tioman, Langkawi and the Perhentian Islands are some
          of the world's most breathtaking islands, and Redang is a scuba diving paradise.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
          On the Borneo side, East Malaysia is known for its wild jungle, rainforests, extraordinary cave systems,
          orangutans, granite peaks and remote tribes. Major cities like Kuching and Kota Kinabalu serve as gateways to
          exploring these natural attractions.
